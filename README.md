# Supervised-Machine-Learning
This is a project that I completed in 6.0002 at MIT. The project was implemented in python and utilized supervised machine learning methods using tumor data from the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Database.

## Breakdown of the Project
The project explores four core topics in machine learning: data preparation, supervised learning, evaluation, and model improvement.

**Part 1: data pre-processing.** 
I created functions to partition the dataset into training and evaluation subsets.
**Part 2: use test data to train the model using a supervised approach.**
I also used the model to make predictions and score labeled evaluation data.**
**Part 3: performance metrics and data visualization. 
I created plots! You can visualize the model now!
**Part 4: feature reduction/elimination.** 
I utilized stochastic methods to optimize the model performance.
**Part 5: Runs the simulation.**
