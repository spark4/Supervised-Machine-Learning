# Supervised-Machine-Learning
This is a project that I completed in 6.0002 at MIT. The project was implemented in python and utilized supervised machine learning methods using tumor data from the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Database.

#Breakdown of the Project
The project explores four core topics in machine learning: data preparation, supervised learning, evaluation, and model improvement.
1. Part 1: data pre-processing. I created functions to partition the dataset into training and evaluation subsets.
1. Part 2: use test data to train the model using a supervised approach. I also used the model to make predictions and score labeled evaluation data.
1. Part 3: performance metrics and data visualization. I created plots!
1. Part 4: feature reduction/elimination. I utilzied stochastic methods to optimize the model performance.
1. Part 5: Runs the simulation.
